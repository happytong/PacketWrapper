"# PacketWrapper" 
To just program for sending out a packet, it could be as simple as C style that just to set each byte of the packet buffer.
But to some C++ experts, they would like to create a few classes to show skills :) 
However, it is good to see one of the complicated mechanism as shown in this packetwrapper class.  
Detailed comment has already given in the codes, I would be glad to hear from you for your opinions!
